# Eternal
**Eternal** is online dating application for android that allows users to anonymously swipe to like or dislike other profiles based on their photos, a bio, and personality. Once two users have "matched", they can exchange messages. 

  Users can be matched by completing custom made personality test, based on Myersâ€“Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI). Each user is assigned to one of sixteen personality types. The test attempts to assign four categories: introversion or extraversion, sensing or intuition, thinking or feeling, judging or perceiving. One letter from each category is taken to produce a four-letter test result, like "INFJ" or "ENFP". The contribution of each category is a percentage value that makes it possible to calculate the match between two users, using specially developed algorithm based on a book "Friendship and love relationships.Advances indescriptive psychology"[[1]](#1)
